# Data-Analysis-with-Python
DonorsChoose is a US based nonprofit organization that allows individuals to donate directly to public school classroom projects. It has raised $685 million for America's classrooms. Teachers at three-quarters of all the public schools in the U.S. have come to DonorsChoose.org to request what their students need, making DonorsChoose.org the leading platform for supporting public education.

## Outline
The goal of this analysis is to extract unusual insights from school donations dataset and provide a solution that will enable DonorsChoose.org to build targeted email campaigns recommending specific classroom requests to prior donors. In this notebook, I have performed an in-depth analysis and exploration on the shared dataset using different libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Scikit, Matplotlib etc.
