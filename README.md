# Data-Analysis-with-Python
DonorsChoose is a US based nonprofit organization that allows individuals to donate directly to public school classroom projects. It has raised $685 million for America's classrooms. Teachers at three-quarters of all the public schools in the U.S. have come to DonorsChoose.org to request what their students need, making DonorsChoose.org the leading platform for supporting public education.

## Outline
The goal of this analysis is to extract unusual insights from school donations dataset and provide a solution that will enable DonorsChoose.org to build targeted email campaigns recommending specific classroom requests to prior donors. In this notebook, I have performed an in-depth analysis and exploration on the shared dataset using different libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Scikit, Matplotlib etc.


## Insight 1: Projects and their Donations
### Wordcloud Analysis:
The most popular keywords used in fully funded projects were "help" and "need". We can consider these keywords attract the donor most. Moreover, in expired projects, "help" and "need" are not used much.

### Impact of Project Grade Level, Project Cost, Project Subject  on donations:
No_of_donors for each Project_Grade_Level_Category
Number of donors for lower grades very high compared to higher grades.
